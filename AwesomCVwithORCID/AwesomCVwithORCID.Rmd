#Do this before running Knit!
#If not installed, install rorcid and usethis packages

#install.packages("rorcid")
#install.packages("usethis")

#Then execute authentification with ORCID. For this you have to be logged in
#ORCID user

#orcid_auth()
#This will open a new browsere window telling you that authentification was
#succesfull and to come back to R.
#In the console a "Bearer" alphanumeric code will appear. Copy the alphanumeric code and have it close by

#Execute the next part in a new sript window:
#library('usethis')
#usethis::edit_r_environ("project")
#This is to edit the R environment of this project alone, but you can use "user" instead too
#A new window will open in the text editor which will be called .REnviron
#Write ORCID_TOKEN="your_alphanumeric_code" with the quoutes
#Save it, close it and restart R

#Now you are authorized to extract info from your ORCID profile


#Also beware of Latex and the latex packages needed for compiling. See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging if you get any errors related to *.tex compiling
